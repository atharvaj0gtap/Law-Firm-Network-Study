In the status plot, you observe that vertices representing partners and
associates cluster together, indicating that lawyers of similar hierarchical
levels tend to interact more frequently within the firm. Partners form
tight-knit groups, reflecting their collaboration on high-level cases,
while associates group together due to shared training or routine casework.
While cross-connections between partners and associates can suggest
hierarchical divides and/or strong mentorship and collaboration.
In the practice plot, clustering highlights how lawyers from the same
practice group work closely together due to the nature of their specialized
cases. However, cross-practice ties suggest interdisciplinary collaboration,
where different practice groups work together on cases requiring diverse legal
expertise, fostering integration across the firm.
