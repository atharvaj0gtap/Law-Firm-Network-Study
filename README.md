# Law-Firm-Network-Study

This dataset comes from a network study of corporate law partnership that was carried out in a Northeastern US corporate law firm, referred to as SG&R, 1988-1991 in New England. It includes (among others) measurements of networks among the 71 attorneys (partners and associates) of this firm, i.e. their co-worker network, advice network, friendship network, and indirect control networks. Various members' attributes are also part of the dataset, including seniority, formal status, office in which they work, gender, law school attended, individual performance measurements (hours worked, fees brought in), attitudes concerning various management policy options, etc.

This dataset was used to identify social processes such as bounded solidarity, lateral control, quality control, knowledge sharing, balancing powers, regulation, etc. among
peers. The ethnography, organizational and network analyses of this case are available in Emmanuel Lazega, The Collegial Phenomenon: The Social Mechanisms of Cooperation Among Peers in a Corporate Law Partnership, Oxford University Press, 2001.
